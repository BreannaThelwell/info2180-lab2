                <p> Women have been integral to the development of technology. For starters, Ada Lovelace. This is name of the creator of what is considered to be the first computer program. In the mid-1800s, she envisioned the potential of machines beyond mere calculations. In the 1970s and 1980s, more women started entering tech fields. As the industry grew, so did the gender disparities. Despite this, pioneers such as Grace Hopper continued to break barriers by championing computer programming languages.</p>
                <p>The topic of diversity has picked up momentum in recent years. Many organisations and initiatives are encouraging women to enter STEM related fields. Although many challenges remain, the impact of women in tech continue to shape the industry, and inspire future generations. </p>
